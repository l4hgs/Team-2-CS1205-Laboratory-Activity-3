📝 Description
Pythonic Orchestra is a Python-based class hierarchy that simulates various musical instruments using object-oriented programming principles. It showcases polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance through four major families of instruments: String, Wind, Plectrum, and Percussion.

Each instrument class encapsulates behaviors specific to its type (e.g., pluck(), strum(), blow_air(), shake()), while sharing a common interface through the abstract base class MusicalInstrument. This system demonstrates how diverse objects can follow a unified structure and exhibit individual behaviors — just like a real orchestra.

▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/
cd 
3. Run the main Python script:
python symphonia.py

You’ll see the demonstration of all the instrument classes in action, each with their unique methods and sounds.
